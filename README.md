# Match-to-retention-time-library
Match metabolites from a retention time library with a similar retention time to experimental data to identify possible candidates, 
then report matches and metabolites meta data.



# Future features 
Aims in the future;
Addition of a GUI, 
possibility of users to input experimental data and retention time libraries. 
include database for the software to use for metabolite matching for example;
MONA, Metabolights, Metabolomics workbench, EMBL, HMDB
Normalise retention times where the experimental data and the library was measured using different conditions, so they can still be matched.
